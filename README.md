# Hash Function in Python
This repository contains a basic hash function implemented in Python. The hash function takes a key as input and produces an index in an array, suitable for use in hash table implementations. The function aims to distribute keys uniformly across the array to minimize collisions, providing a basic yet effective hashing mechanism.

## Usage
To use the hash function, simply call the hash_function method with the key and the size of the array as arguments. Here's an example:

This will calculate the index for the key "example_key" in an array of size 10.

index = hash_function("example_key", 10)
print(f"The index for key 'example_key' is {index}")

# djb2 Hash Function in Python
This repository contains an implementation of the djb2 hash function in Python. The djb2 hash function, devised by Dan Bernstein, is a simple and efficient algorithm for generating hash values for strings.

## Description
The djb2_hash function takes a string input and produces a hash value based on the characters in the string. It implements the djb2 algorithm, which is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in generating well-distributed hash values with relatively low collision rates.

## Usage
To use the djb2_hash function, simply call it with a string input. Here's an example:


hash_value = djb2_hash("example_key")
print(f"The hash value for 'example_key' is {hash_value}")
This will calculate the hash value for the string "example_key" using the djb2 algorithm.

## Getting Started
To get started with using the djb2 hash function in your Python projects, simply copy the djb2_hash function from djb2_hash.py into your codebase. You can then call the function with string inputs to generate hash values as needed.
