# Hash Function in Python
This repository contains a basic hash function implemented in Python. The hash function takes a key as input and produces an index in an array, suitable for use in hash table implementations. The function aims to distribute keys uniformly across the array to minimize collisions, providing a basic yet effective hashing mechanism.

## Usage
To use the hash function, simply call the hash_function method with the key and the size of the array as arguments. Here's an example:

This will calculate the index for the key "example_key" in an array of size 10.

index = hash_function("example_key", 10)
print(f"The index for key 'example_key' is {index}")

# djb2 Hash Function in Python
This repository contains an implementation of the djb2 hash function in Python. The djb2 hash function, devised by Dan Bernstein, is a simple and efficient algorithm for generating hash values for strings.

## Description
The djb2_hash function takes a string input and produces a hash value based on the characters in the string. It implements the djb2 algorithm, which is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in generating well-distributed hash values with relatively low collision rates.

## Usage
To use the djb2_hash function, simply call it with a string input. Here's an example:


hash_value = djb2_hash("example_key")
print(f"The hash value for 'example_key' is {hash_value}")
This will calculate the hash value for the string "example_key" using the djb2 algorithm.

## Getting Started
To get started with using the djb2 hash function in your Python projects, simply copy the djb2_hash function from djb2_hash.py into your codebase. You can then call the function with string inputs to generate hash values as needed.


# hash_djb2 Function
The hash_djb2 function hashes a string using the djb2 algorithm, which is a simple and efficient hash function devised by Dan Bernstein. It takes a string input and produces a hash value based on the characters in the string.

hash_value = hash_djb2("example_key")
print(f"The hash value for 'example_key' is {hash_value}")
This will calculate the hash value for the string "example_key" using the djb2 algorithm.

## key_index Function
The key_index function calculates the index for a given key using the djb2 hash function. It takes a key and the size of the hash table array as input and returns the index at which the key/value pair should be stored in the array of the hash table.

index = key_index("example_key", 10)
print(f"The index for key 'example_key' is {index}")
This will calculate the index for the key "example_key" in an array of size 10 using the djb2 hash function.

# Hash Table Implementation in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of a hash table data structure, along with basic operations such as adding elements and viewing the hash table.

## Description

A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

The implementation provided here includes the following components:

- **HashNode Class**: Represents a node in the hash table, containing a key-value pair and a reference to the next node in case of collision.
- **HashTable Class**: Represents the hash table itself, containing an array of buckets and methods for adding elements and viewing the table.
- **Hashing Functions**: Includes the `hash_djb2` function for computing hash values and the `key_index` function for determining the index for a given key.
- **Main Program**: Provides an interactive menu for users to add elements to the hash table, view the contents of the table, and exit the program.
